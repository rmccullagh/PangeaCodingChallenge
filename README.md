.NET Core is required. Follow the instructions for your operating system to 
install it.

# Windows

# Build & Run
```
git clone https://github.com/rmccullagh/PangeaCodingChallenge.git
cd PangeaCodingChallenge/src/Pengea.Coding.Challenge
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

This will run the initial migrations so it will take a few seconds to respond as you then navigate to http://localhost:5000
